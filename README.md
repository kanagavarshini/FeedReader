### Description of Project
-------------------------------------------------------------
The following project is a working RSS feed that contains four different feeds each containing several links to relevant articles, websites, and references that populate when that feed is accessed via a navigation menu that toggles visibilty when the hamburger icon is clicked. The feeds are populated using a Google API which has been provided in the dependencies. This functionality was completed prior to receiving the project and the main focus of this exercise was to create a series of Jasmine tests for the functionality of the application, which are located by the following relative path: ./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

## Why this Project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

### Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clone the repo - (https://github.com/kanagavarshini/FeedReader) to a local directory and run via your specific local environment setup.

### Dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ jQuery
+ Jasmine
+ Normalize.css
+ Icomoon
+ Google Fonts
+ Handlebars
+ JSAPI
